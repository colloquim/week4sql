# SQL Practice Queries

This project contains SQL scripts for creating tables and running sample queries.

## Files
- `student_table.sql` → Creates the `student` table with id, fullName, and age.
- `insert_students.sql` → Inserts sample student records.
- `update_student.sql` → Updates a student’s age.
- `payments_queries.sql` → Includes queries for totals, averages, and maximum payments.
- `orderdetails_queries.sql` → Queries for calculating product totals.

## How to Run
1. Open your SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
2. Run the scripts in the order you need, for example:
   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p database_name < student_table.sql
